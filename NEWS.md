========================

I gotta say it that the interaction between this and x-python is pretty cool, and the possibiilities for which direction to go in on both projects are numerous and vast.

How did I get here? Well, I was pouring over trace logs to find bugs in x-python, and then realized, hey, I've written a debugger already for Python that could help here.

So here it is.  I can die now and my life is complete.

Although commands like `next`, `finish` and breakpoints, aren't there yet, rather than sit on it this, I thought I'd release. This is very usuable as is - release early and often!
